## Halloween Mini-Project
# Importing Candy Data
```{r}
# Save your input data file into your Project directory
candy_file <- "~/Downloads/candy-data.csv"
candy <- read.csv(candy_file, row.names=1)
head(candy)
```

# Q1 - How many different candy types are in this dataset?
```{r}
# Number of different candy types
num_candy_types <- nrow(candy)
num_candy_types #answer = 85
```

# Q2 - How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?
```{r}
colnames(candy)

# Number of fruity candy types
num_fruity_types <- sum(candy$fruity == 1)
num_fruity_types #answer = 38
```

# Interim
```{r}
candy["Twix", ]$winpercent #81.6%
```

# Q3 - What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?
```{r}
candy["Rolo", ]$winpercent #65.7%
```

# Q4 - What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?
```{r}
candy["Kit Kat", ]$winpercent #76.8%
```

# Q5 - What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?
```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars", ]$winpercent #49.7%

#candy |> 
  #filter(rownames(candy) %in% c("Kit Kat",
                                #"Tootsie Roll Snack Bars") ) |>
  #select(winpercent)
```

# Interim
```{r}
#candy |>
  #filter(winpercent > 75) |>
  #filter(pricepercent < 0.5)

library("skimr")
skim(candy)
```

# Q6 - Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?
```{r}
#row 12 (winpercent) looks on a different scale then the other rows. Although the question asks a column. So the answer will probably be the last column, the hist column.
```

# Q7 - What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?
```{r}
#0 indicates the absence of chocolate in that candy type.
#1 indicates the presence of chocolate in that candy type.
```

# Q8 - Plot a histogram of winpercent values
```{r}
# Plot histogram using base R
hist(candy$winpercent, main="Histogram of Win Percent", xlab="Win Percent", col="lightblue", border="black")

library(ggplot2)
# Plot histogram using ggplot
ggplot(candy, aes(x=winpercent)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=5, fill="lightblue", color="black") +
  labs(title="Histogram of Win Percent", x="Win Percent", y="Frequency")
```

# Q9 - Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?
```{r}
# Load moments package for skewness calculation
library(moments)

# Calculate skewness
winpercent_skewness <- skewness(candy$winpercent, na.rm = TRUE)
winpercent_skewness #answer = 0.33%

# Since it only has a skewness of 0.33%. It is pretty good symmetrical. 0.33% means slightly right-skewed, meaning little bit more points to the right. But I think it is quite symmetrical.
```

# Q10 - Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?
```{r}
# Calculate mean and median
mean_winpercent <- mean(candy$winpercent, na.rm = TRUE)
median_winpercent <- median(candy$winpercent, na.rm = TRUE)

mean_winpercent #answer = 50.3
median_winpercent #answer = 47.8\

# Since the mean (50.3) is above 50%, the center of the distribution is above 50%.
```

# Q11 - On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?
```{r}
# Calculate average winpercent for chocolate and fruity candies
mean_chocolate <- mean(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)], na.rm = TRUE)
mean_fruity <- mean(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)], na.rm = TRUE)

mean_chocolate #answer = 60.9
mean_fruity #answer = 44.1

# So the average of chocolate is higher
```

# Q12 - Is this difference statistically significant?
```{r}
# Perform t-test between chocolate and fruity candies
t_test_result <- t.test(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)], 
                         candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)], 
                         na.rm = TRUE)

t_test_result
#  p-value = 2.871e-08. this is significant
```

# Q13 - What are the five least liked candy types in this set?
```{r}
# Get the five least liked candy types
least_liked_candies <- head(candy[order(candy$winpercent), ], n=5)
least_liked_candies #Nik L Nip, Boston Baked Beans, Chiclets, Super Bubble, Jawbusters
```

# Q14 - What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?
```{r}
# Get the top 5 favorite candy types
favorite_candies <- head(candy[order(-candy$winpercent), ], n=5)
favorite_candies #Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, Reese's Miniatures, Twix, Kit Kat, Snickers
```

# Q15 - Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.
```{r}
# Load the ggplot2 package
library(ggplot2)

# Create the bar plot
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(x = winpercent, y = rownames(candy)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Candy Ranking by Win Percent", x = "Win Percent", y = "Candy Type") +
  theme_minimal()
```

# Q16 - This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?
```{r}
# Load the ggplot2 package
library(ggplot2)

# Create the bar plot
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Candy Ranking by Win Percent", x = "Win Percent", y = "Candy Type") +
  theme_minimal()
```

# Interim
```{r}
my_cols=rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols) 
```

```{r}
#If you want to color Kit Kat
my_cols[rownames(candy)=="Kit Kat"] = "blue"

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols) 
```

# Q17 - What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?
```{r}
#Sixlets
```

# Q18 - What is the best ranked fruity candy?
```{r}
#Starburst
```

# Interim
```{r}
library(ggrepel)

# How about a plot of price vs win
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 5)
```

# Q19 - Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?
```{r}
highest_rank <- rownames(candy)[which.max(candy$winpercent / candy$pricepercent)]
candy["Tootsie Roll Midgies",]$winpercent
```

# Q20 - What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?
```{r}
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
#Answer = Nik L Nip, Nestle Smarties, Ring pop, Hershey's Krackel and Hershey's Milk Chocolate.
#Answer = Nik L Nip is least popular
```

# Q21 - Make a barplot again with geom_col() this time using pricepercent and then improve this step by step, first ordering the x-axis by value and finally making a so called “dot chat” or “lollipop” chart by swapping geom_col() for geom_point() + geom_segment()
```{r}
# Load the ggplot2 package
library(ggplot2)

# Create the bar plot
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(pricepercent, reorder(rownames(candy),pricepercent)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Candy Ranking by Price Percent", x = "Price Percent", y = "Candy Type") +
  theme_minimal()

# Make a lollipop chart of pricepercent
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(pricepercent, reorder(rownames(candy), pricepercent)) +
  geom_segment(aes(yend = reorder(rownames(candy), pricepercent), 
                   xend = 0), col="gray40") +
    geom_point()
```

# Interim
```{r}
library(corrplot)

cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```

# Q22 - Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?
```{r}
# fruity and chocolate & bar and pluribus
```

# Q23 - Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?
```{r}
# chocolate and bar & chocolate and winpercent
```

# Interim
```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale=TRUE)
summary(pca)

pca$rotation[,1]

plot(pca$x[,1:2], pch=6)
plot(pca$x[,1:2], col=my_cols, pch=16)

# Make a new data-frame with our PCA results and candy data
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])

p <- ggplot(my_data) + 
        aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, 
            size=winpercent/100,  
            text=rownames(my_data),
            label=rownames(my_data)) +
        geom_point(col=my_cols)

p

library(ggrepel)

p + geom_text_repel(size=3.3, col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 7)  + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title="Halloween Candy PCA Space",
       subtitle="Colored by type: chocolate bar (dark brown), chocolate other (light brown), fruity (red), other (black)",
       caption="Data from 538")
```

# Interim 2
```{r}
library(plotly)
ggplotly(p)

par(mar=c(8,4,2,2))
barplot(pca$rotation[,1], las=2, ylab="PC1 Contribution")
```

# Q24 - What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?
```{r}
#Strongly picked up are fruity, hard, and pluribus
# Yes it makes sense Fruity hard candies in a bag.
```
